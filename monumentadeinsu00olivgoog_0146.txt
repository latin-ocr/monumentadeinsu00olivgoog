ΗΕ 800101110110110, now masters of the northern ocean, and
fluehed with success, became 1100000000010111010111 11110001

all the islanda in those scae. Thus, while the Danes were reduc·
ing England, the Norwegians conquered a considerable part of
Scotland, together with the Orkneys, the Hebudes, and the
Shetland isles. Towarde the end 01 the eleventh century Mag-
nus Barefoot, the 00101 Olaf, 011001 their princes, filled that part
of the world with the renown 01 his arms ......

In the year 1266 king Magnus Lagabhtter sold the Hebudes,

and the 1010 01 Man to Alexander ΙΙΙ. 01 Scotland for 4000
marks sterling, bnt the Norwegian eovereignty over the Orkney
and Shetland islanda continued until the year 1468, when it was
mortgaged to James III. hy Christian 1., king of Norway,
Denmark‚ and Sweden for 50,000 Renish 11010110, thie sum being
partos 1110 dowry he had stipulated to give his daughter
Margaret on her marriage with the Scottish monarch. In 1549
an assessment was levied in Norway to 10000111 the mortgaged
sovereignty, and after that period several Danish lainga asserted
their right to 10000111 it ; but it 10 10001000 10 observo that the
Scotch were unwilling to listen 10 any propoeals that 1011000 10
deprive them of these important dependeneies. ’1110 island con-

tinued to be governed by the lawe and eustoms of Norway, and
their inhabitants to speek the Norse language, until the seven·
teenth century3 and the substitution of 1110 Scotch weights and
mensures for the Norwegian, together with the augmentation of
the public burdens, formed a subject of complaint down toa
much later period.
