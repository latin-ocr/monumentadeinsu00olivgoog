HEN Alexander ΙΙΙ., king of scotland, had possessed

himself of these western islanda, partly by victory, partly
by purchase of the king of Norway, he set about the reduction
of Man as one of them, and by the bravery of Alexander Steward
brought it under his dominion‚ and set up a petty king there on
condition of being ready whenever called upon to assist him in
any war at sea with ten ships. Mary, daughter of Reginald,
king cf Man, who was become liege man to John, king of Eng-
land, preferred a suit for the island to that prince, but was
answered, she must lay her claim before the king of Scots, at

that time in possession of the island. Her son’s son, John
Waldebeof, (into which family she had married) prosecuted his

grandmother’s claim in parliament 33 Edward the first, before
the king cf England as lord paramount over the king os Scotland.
He obtained, however, no other answer than (tc borrow the
terma of the record) that, “he might prosecute his claim before
the justices cf the king’s Beneh, be heard and have justice done
him.’' But what· he could not effect by right, William de
Montacute‚ his kinsman, descended from the kings of Man, did
by arms. For with a body cf English troops hastily collected
he drove all the Seots out of the island3 but having contracted
a considerable debt for this war, and being unable to discharge
it, he mortgaged the island and its revenues for seven years to
Anthony Bec‚ bishop of Durham and patriarch of Jerusalem, to
whom the king afterwards gave it for life. King Edward II.
