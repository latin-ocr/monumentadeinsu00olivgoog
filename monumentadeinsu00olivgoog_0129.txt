the island conceded to Stenley and his heire, in these words :-
“ We, for and in consideration that the said John Stanley, has
restored to us our same Letters Patent, in chancery to he mn-
celled, have granted to the aforesaid John Stanley the said island
ete.'’ From these words, and obserring the time that those
former hetters Patent were conceded for life, before that the earl
of Northumberland was banished‚ the lawyers pronounoed that
the king could not give the island for life, because as yet, it was
not adjudged as having fallen into the hands of the king, and
consequently the later Iretters Patent, which were founded on
the restoration of the former, were of no force: that the king
was deceived by a false suggestion, aud that therefore his grant
was void and of no virtue. But the queen for all this poelded up
her right in it, and an agreement was made between the uncle
and nieces.
