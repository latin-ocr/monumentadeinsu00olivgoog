“ Item, carta de Glenhelk qui fuit reg' de Man.”
Whethcr any of the above muniments are still extant it is im-

* possible to say, but if so, at some future period they may yet sec

the light. The last entry on the list is remarkable, as no ruler

ἓ of the name of Glenhelk is known, by tradition or otherwise, as

ἱ having possessed the Isle of Man-its productiori might open up

¹ a new phase in Manx history.

Before concluding Ihave to express the obligation Ι am under
tc Richard Sims, Esq., of the British Museum, sor his assistance

ι, and advice in forming the present collection, and more especially

for his invaluable skill in the deciphering and reading of ancient

³ manuscripts, in which department he is second to ncne in the
kingdom. My thanks are also due to William Hardy‚ Esq.,

t

hesper of the Records of the Duchy of Lancaster, for many
important documents and his polite attentioris to myself when

searching for the ancient arms of this Island.
To John James Moore, ¹idsq. ; Mr. Robert Fargher‚ cf the

Mense Herald; the Rev. Messra Duggan, B. Harrison, Simp-

son, Kermode, Airey‚ and many other friends, too numerous to

mention, Iam indebted for much local information. Το these

and to all others who hsvc so freely contributed their assistance,
I bag to return my sincere thanhs.
