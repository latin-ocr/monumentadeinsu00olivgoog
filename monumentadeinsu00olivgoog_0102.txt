POLYDORE VERGIIn

Ap„ 1470.
ow THE ISLES ow BRITAIN.

HERE ere menie iles adjacent to Briteyne‚ and two of in-
different fame, the one called the Ile of wighte beingc
against the south bancke cf England ; the other ilond, heinge
somewhah famous, is the Ile of Mone, or Man, hythe exchaunge
of one letter, which one the north side inclincth towards Scot-
lande, southeastward towards Englond, on the weste towards
Irelonde. In olde time, whensoever there appeared decrease or
ebbe in the ocean, it was divided with so small a see, and was so
near¹ with the lande, chata man might have gone thereunho
without shippinge‚ which thinge (es Cornelius Tacitus iecordchhe)
was donne of the Romaines.* There are some which dare affirme

'chatky' is the lle of Mone which men cell Angleeea‚ beinge
nearer walles.

ὕ Polydoro here falls into the vulgar error of Hector Boetius, and confounds the
Mona of Tacitus, with the Mona of Cesar. Tacitus never speaks of the Isle of Mans but

only of Angleeey.
