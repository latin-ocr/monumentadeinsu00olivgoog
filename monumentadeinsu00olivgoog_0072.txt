therefore provoked the king and the kingdom to war, burning
their own houses and those of their neighbours, that the king,

when he arrived, might not find either shelter or food for his
army ; and indulged in rapine and incendiarism, heaping injury
on injury. On hearing of this, the king oi Scotland collected
his troops from every quanter, and marching to meet them, drew
up his forces in order and engaged them in open battle; the
fortune of war turning against the Galwegians, they were put to
ssight, and the royal troops, pursuing them at the sword's point,
slew many thousands of them, and those who were taken alive by
the king and his soldiers were putto an ignominious death, with-
out any chance ef ransoming themselves. Some threw themselves

on the king's morey, and were consigned to close imprisonment
by him till he could consult as to what should be done with them ;

and all ef them, together with their descendente, he, not without
good reason, disinherited. Having gained this victory the king

indivisi. Prevoeantes igitur Regem cum regno ad pralium, mdes
proprias et finitimas combusserunt, ne adveniens Rex oum exer-
citu inveniret hospitia vel victualia: intenderunt que rapinis et
incendiis, injurias injuriis cumulantes. Quod audiam Rex Scotiae,
collectis undecunque viribus, eis obviam perrexit, et dispositis
bellicis legionibus, campestri certamine eosdem est aggressus.
Et verso pondere prelii super Galewenses, sugam inire sunt eom-
pulsi: quos persequentes Regales in ore gladii mults millia corum
occiderunt. Illos vero quos Rex vel ejus commilitones vivos
apprehendit, sine redemptione ignominiosa morte punivit. Veni-
entes autem ad suam misericordiam, vinculis ct arctae custodie,
donec deliberatum foret judicio quid de ipsis fieret, mancipavit:
omnes autem cum sua posteritate, non sine ratione exhaeredavit.
