¹used on the Impression of the great Seal for that Island for the
future*

Ι would here observa, before Ι proceed further, that the Title
os Dei Gratia was used so long since, and when the Montagues
Earls of Salisbury had this Island they continued the attribute
of Dei Gratia, as may be seen in Mr. Madox's formularia-
Anglican: No. Dlxxii. par la Graes de Dieux, whereof the
original is still remaining. ’

Mr. Camden‚ in the above recited place, remarks further, that
· when the Scots recovered this Island, that tho Randolph anda
long time after Alexander, Duke of Albany stiled themselves
Lords of Man and bore the Arms that the later Kings os the
Island did, namely, three arm'd Legs of a man link’d together
and bending in the hams lilre the three nalred Lege which were
formerly stamped upon the Sieilian Coins. Iwish he had been
more particular, because it seems as if he had seen sorne succes-
sions of the Seals and probably there may be several still remain-

ing in the Island.† And I sho‘¹ have been glad to have been
inform'd with the true reason, why the antient Seal with the

Impression of a Ship was alter’d into that new forme. Pro-
bably it might be owing to some such Cause for raising money
as our Rich. Ι. did upon the alteration of his first Seal, altering
it from the two Lions combatant into the present figure.
