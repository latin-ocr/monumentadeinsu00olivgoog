to the Christian faith, he placed over each of them one or
more Bishops from among his disciples, and thenÎ‡ returned
to Ireland. For St. Patriek was acenstomed to appoint
Bishops, not only in cities, but also in towns and the more
celebrated places, lest any who had been baptized should be
deprived of Episcopal confirmation. Thus he provided, that
the faithful might have present, one who could administer
to them the Pontifical office, while the Dioneae, not being too
extensive, required not the withdrawal from it of the presence
and care of their pastor. 'Phe inhabitants of some of these Islands
having receded from the Faith, afterwards renouneed the law of
God, which was preached by St. Patriclr, and therefore, to this
day, are deprived of the special gift of God, which through the
prayers of St. Patrick freed from all venemens animala the

salis ad fidem Christi conversis, singulis singulos, autetiam plures
praefecit praesules, de discipulis suis: sicque Hiberniam repetiit.
Consuevit enim S. Patricius, non solum in vibibus, verumetiam
in oppidis, et locis celebrioribus Episcopos constituere, ne bapti-
zati ullatenus defraudarentur Episcopali confirmatione. Hoc etiam

extensa non subtraheret illis presentiam atque custodiam sui
pastoris. Quarundam Insularnm incolae legem dei per S. Patricium
praedicata abiecerunt, abalienati afide retrorsum et ideo usque
in hodiernum diem privantur speciali Dei dono, quod caeteris
Insulis in fide suscepta perseverantibus, super venonosorum
animalium abdicatione per Patrieii preces constat collatum.
