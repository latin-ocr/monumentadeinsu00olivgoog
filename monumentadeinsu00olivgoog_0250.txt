Muoh confusion exieus as ιο this biehcp. In ιιο chronicle his patronymic is
distinctly stated ιο ιο Hamcnd, ιιο son ol J ule, a Mammam and ιο must either
heve baon antecedent to, or cotemporaneons with Olavc tho First. By nome
singular mistalre ιο ιιο been conlounded with a certain curione character called
Wimnnd, said by Matthew Paris ιο heva been a Monlr oi Sais in Normsndy.
This extraordinary personage, who was aewerd tielwp in ιιο real acceptaticn oi
the term, carried on euch a vigor-ons orumde against Scotlsnd, whose orown he

claimed, that he was tho terror oi his age3 embodying in himself ιιο threeicld
exhibition oi abiahop‚ e warrior, and a iraebocter. At last ιο was taken, says
Parvus, in his Historia Reum emtionem, castrsted, and deprived oi his sight-
not ios ιιο love ol heaven, ιο aeirety informs us, but lor ιιο salae oi the kingdom

cf scotland, whose peace, ιο sorely disturbet-“comprehensum vexerunt
utrumque illi oculum quia uterqm nequam orat, eruerunt, causamque verulent

germinis amputantes, eum pro pace regni Scottorum, non propter regnumocslorum
castraverunt.”

How a pesoelul Msnx bishop could hare been confounded with such a character
as Wimnnd is difficolt ιο conceire; and still more strange is it, that Drake,
Willis, and others should have fallen into the same error. They mmt have
known thet had such a bishop really existed, ιο would have been mentioned by

historiens oi the age, and largely commented upon for his atrocities.
