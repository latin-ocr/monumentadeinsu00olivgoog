insumountnble. 'i'he paoent monastery does ιοι appear ιο have rendered any
ιιιίιιιιιο, ιιι ιιι iselsted position of Itmhen debarred it from participationin
the wealth, which, ιι that period, the linga ιιι rulers of the earth were hrishing
with bountiiul hands on the monastic institutions of Britain. In connection aith
ahia subject it would be interesting to inquire whether any monastic establish-
ment existed prior ιο 01ιιι·ι giit; but ιιιοτιιιιιι] there are no documenta
extant, throwing any light οι the question, so that we are left entirely ιο ιιι
jecture, or the miaty regions oi tradition, to arrivs ιι any-thing like ι ιιιιιιιιιοη
conclusion. Tanner, in his Nortia sonores, informs ns that ι religione house
was commenced at Rushen ιι early as 1098, by hfacblanis, governor oi the Isle;
but upon what authority he makes this statement does not appear. If Tannerbe
correct, thie was the year in which Magnus uudertool his great expedition to the
western Iales, aud landed in ιιιι ιο reestablish his authority, somewhst endan
gered by intestine strife. He pot down the feud between itachianis ιιι Other,
ιιι shortly afterwards sailed ior lreland, where he perished. 'Phe monhiah
chronicler who nrmtcs these events is altogether silent as ιο the foundation cis
religione house by itachianis, which, had such really been the ease, he would ιοι
have failed ιο record. Δ cuncus fact, however, in connection with thie subject
is ιιι mention oi ι monastery ιι Rusben called St beoc, in ι boll oi Pope
Eugenius the Third, in which he confirma to Furness the gift oi Olave, from the
lande cf Cernecset, ιο the above house. This seems ιο strengthen the popular
belief in s reiigious institution prior ιο Rushen,end stall eventsis very remarkable

The original establiahment consisted of ιι cbbot ιιι twolre moute, who followed
the cistercien ruis. The service oi the Abbey vas conducted as follows :—l'h⁶

After matins the bell rung again ior the Many mass, ιιι ιι eight o’cloek ior the

ment, and the waahing oi the vestmenta of the altar. He provided palma on Palm

with swand in his hand* The abbot, in right oi his position, was ι baron oi the
