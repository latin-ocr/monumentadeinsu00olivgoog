'P the time that King Haoo ruled over Norway‚ Alexander,
theson of King William, was then reigning over Seotland.
He was a great prince and very ambitious of this world’s praise. p

He sent from Scotland in the western sea, two bishops to King
' Haeo.. At first they begged to know if Haeo would give up
those territorias in the Hebrides which King Magnus Bane-sont l
had unjustly wrested from Maleolm, predecessor to the Scottish f
. ¹king. 'Phe king, Haeo, said that Magnus had settled with Mal- l

colm what possessione the Norwegians should have1n Sootland, l

or in the Islands which lay near it. He affirmed, however, that η
the king ol Sootland had no sovereignity ιιι the Hebrides at the l
time that King Magnus won them from King Godred, and also l
that King Magnus only asserted his birthright. The commis-
sioners then said that the king of Scotland was willing to purchase ι
all the Hebrides from King Haeo, and entreatcd him to value
them in fine silver, The king replied, he knew no such urgent
want of money as would obliga him to sell his inheritanoe. With
that answer the messengers departed. From this cause some ¹
misunderstanding arose between the kings. The Scottish mon-
archs, however, frequently renewed the negociation, and sent
many proposals, but the Soots received no other explanation than ’
what is here related. ⁴
