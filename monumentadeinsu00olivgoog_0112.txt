our natica, should be rejected by the jndgment of foreigners (as
it has ever been the habit with natione, that they should
determine something certain concerning themselves, aud refer
their origin to some cause) although neither the earliest his-
tories deny it, nor any other argument erista, nevertheless wa
cannot agree with the ancientsthat the Britons derived their
name from Brutus, and thc Cambrians from Camber, as Humphry
Lloyd and all others assert, although it has pleased that Scotch-
man Buehanan, to whom as a poet not over scrupulous it was
allowable to rave and to feign‚ petulantly to detract lrorn the
characteres that learned man, (as though he could not sufficiently
· rely upon his own merit without detracting from another man)
and we ourselves, on account of the name of Welsh at first given
to us by our enemy, but previously unknown to us, by a new
fable, as it were, on that account decide that we arc descended
from the Gauls. Indead itis the vice of our age, from which

appellatione, lingua, origine, exterorum judicio esse rejicienda.
Quum tamen nec Historiae primae negent, nec aliud argumentum
existat rdlum, quam aBruto, Brytannos, et Cambrenses aCambro
nomen sortitos, cum veteribus non putemne, ut Humfridus
Lloyde ac alii omnes asserunt, libuit tamen illi a Bouthchwanan
Scato, cui videlicet Poetae non satis sobrio et furere et fingere
licuit, et illi viro docto petulanter detrahere ; (quasi sua virtuti
non satis confideret nisi aliurn traduxisset) et nos propter imposi-
tum ab hostibus initio, nobis ignotum adhuc, Wallorum nomen
novo figmento, Gallis, quasi inde propagatos assignare. Verum
id aetatis nostrae, vitium est, a qno ille non erat immunis, ut

vetera, sancta, publica, ut que merito estimationis opinionem diu
adepta sunt, maledicere, obscurare, novisque conjecturarum mon.
