Then there came 01100 Predieant 0⁰r Barelooted friars, from the

Sootch monarch 10 king Haeo, to sound him about a pacification
between the two sovereigne. Atthis juncture king 11000 001
king John 01 liberty, and bidding him goin peace wherever he
would, gave him several rich presente. He yir'omised king Haeo

1ο do everything in bia power 10 effect a peace between him
and ue 00000 king, and that he 0001 immediately return 1ο

king Haeo whenever he desired him. Soon after king Haco
sent Gilbert bishop 01 Hermai, Henry bishop 01 Orkney, Andrew
υ Ν1001000, Andrew Plytt, and Paul Scor as envoys to treet about ³
a peace with the king 01 Scotland. They went to the Scottish
monarch and laid before him their overtures. He received them

honorably, seemed inclined 10 compromise, and said that such ,

terma 01 accommodatiori as he would consent to, would besent 10
king Haeo. The commissionem departed, and the Scottish
envoys arrived soon atter. King Haec had ordered that all the
islanda 10 the west 01 Scotland, which he called his, should be
written down. The king of Scotlaud again had named all such
aa he would not relinquieh. These were Buta, Arrun, and the
two Cumbras, as 10 other matters there was very little dispnte
between the two sovereigna3 but however no agreement took
place. The Scoteh purposely declined any accommodatiori,
because summer was drawing 10 0 close, and the weather had
become bad. Finding thia, Haeo sailed in with all his forces,
past the Gumbras.

Afterwarda an interview in Scotland was agreed upon fora
reconciliation. King Haeo sent thither 0 bishop and 0 baron 3
and 10 meet them came some knights and monks. 'l'hey spoke
much about accommodatiori, bnt, at last, things ended the same
way as before. Towards the conclusion of the day a greater
number 01 80010 convened from the country than the Norwegiane
thought were to be trusted. They therefore retiring to the ships,
waited on the king, and told him their opinion. 'Phe generality
advised him to declare that the truce was now ended, and to give
orders 10 plunder as the army was very short 01 provisione.
