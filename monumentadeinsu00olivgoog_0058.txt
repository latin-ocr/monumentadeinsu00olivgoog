HENRY OF HUNTINGDON.

HEIR king, Edwin, had grown to n degree of temporal power
such us no English king hed possessed before lnm; for he
ruled throughout the bonnds of Britain and all the provinces
which were inhabited by English or Britons were under his do-
minion. He nlso reduced to the subjection of the English the
Mevanion islnnds, the first of which, or the one that lies to the
south is the largest, and from its fortunate fertility, most pro-
ductive of oorn; it contains the ferme of nine hundred and sixty
families3 the second three hundred and more.

Ex nonnil. LIB. 111.

EX vero eornm Edwinus tante potestate terreni creverat
imperii, ut qnod nemo Anglorunr ente eum omnis Britannice
fines acceperet, et omnes provincie, quas vel Angli, vel Britones
habitabant, sub ditione ejus essent. Quin et Mevaniae insulas
imperio subjugavit Anglorum: querum prior, quae ad austrum est,
et situ amplior et frugum proventu atque ubertate felicior, non·
gentarum sexaginta familiarum mensnram, secunde trecentarum
et ultre spatium tenet.
