The first author who mentions this leland is Cesar ; forthere can be but little

doubt, thet by the Mona of which he speaks in his Oommentera'ea, placing it iu the
midst between Britain and lroland, we are to understand blan ; ee that the Mona
of Tacitus, which he acquaints ue heda fordable atr-ait between it and the conti·
nent, can be applied only to Anglesey. Pliny has eet down both Islands: hiena,
, by which he intends Anglesey, and Monabia, which is lton. In Ptolemy we find
Monoeda or Menoida, thet is tbe further or remote Mon. Orosius styles it Mon-
avia, tells ua that it was not extremely fertile, and that thia es well aa Ireland was
then possessed by the Soots. Beda, who, ee we heve formerly remarked‚ distin·
guiahee clearly two ¹Menevien Islande, names the northern Menaria, bestowing the

epithet of southern upon Anglesey. In some copies of Nennius thie Isleie de· '

nominated Eubonia, in others Menaria, but both are explained to mean Man.
Alured of Beverley also speaks of it as one of the Menarian Islande. The
Britains, in their languege, called it Mamw, more properly Mein au, thetis a
little leland, which seems to be Latinized ln the word Menaria. All which clearly
provee that this small isle wee es early inhabited, end aa well known to the rest
of the world, ss either Britain or Ireland. This very fact, ae to which we cannot
entertain tha least doubt, menifestly implies that the pecple living here were
employed, es well aa subsisted income way or other, and if we could anywhere
meet with a distinet account oi this, it would supply us with the ancient history
of blan. But aa we have no chronicle of this kind, wemuatpickup what scattered
hints we can, not to emuse the reader with hard names aud antiquated fabios,
but, if it be in any degree practicable, to furniehhim with the means of forming
aomo idea of the pest, present, end possible idea of this leland.

We have in a former sectien shown thet in the close of the firat century, the
Druids, who were the Prieste, Propheta. and Philosophers of the Old Britainn,
were finally expelled by Julius Agricola from the southern Mona, and we ara
told with great probability tbnt they took shelter in the northern. This Ieland
they found well planted with fir-s, so that they had in some measure what they
delighted in meat, the sheltor of trees, but, however, not the shelter of thece trees
in which they most delighted ; and, therefore, these they introduced. No history
telle us this; but we learn it from more certain authority, great woodo of fir
having been discovered interred in the bowels ef the earth, and here and there
small groves of oalrs; but as these trees ere never met with intermixed, eo it is
plain they never grew together ; and as the former are by far the most numerous
we may presnme thern the natural produce of the country, and that the latter
were planted and preserved by the Druids. They gave the pecple with whom
they lived, and over whom they ruled, e gentle government, wiee lewa, bnt with
theeeavery superstitious religion. Itis aleo very likely thet they hindered
them, aa rnuch es they could from having any correspondence with their neigh·
bonrs, which is th'e remon that though the laland is mentioned by eo many
writera not one of them, before Orosius, says samuch aeaword eboutthe in·
