HE following collection of documento relating to the Isle ol
Man was undertalrcn at the request of the Manu Sooiety,

with the view of giving to the publio such monuments as are

extant of its early history. This little spot, for a long period, ’

has played no insignifioant part in the destinies of the United
Kingdom; and from its connection with foreign States, and the
changes undergone, must always prove a source of attraction to

the archaeologist, the historian, and the statesman. Hitherto no ’
effort has been made to form a series of muniments illustrative of

its early state, and such few excerpts ae we already possess have,
in the majority of instances, been taken from defective and un·
certain sources. In arranging the materiale of the Monumeota,
the author has endeavoured to follow the originale as closely as
circumstances would allow, both as respecto their literary as well
as historio order ; 'and in every case where these have not been
accessible, recourse has been had to the most approved standard
works, as Rymer²s Foedera, the publications of the Record Com·
mission, the Pateat and Porliameotory Raro, and these, with the
Hortatore, Uettonica, and additional Maouooripta in the British

Museum, form the basis of the present collection.
