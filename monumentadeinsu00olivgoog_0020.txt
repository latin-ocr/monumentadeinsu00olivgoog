collection. At the request of the Marnr Society its orthographieal
and literary peculiarities have been retained. 'l'hc chronicle was

it was given to Sir Robert Cotton, in 1620. vhe greater part of

meet with some continuation of its history. Nothing of the sort,

however, is to bc found, and it can only be ascribed to the
