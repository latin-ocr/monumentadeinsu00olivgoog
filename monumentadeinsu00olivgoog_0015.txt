'Phe difficulties to be surmounted in works of this sort will be
readily understood, when it is mentioned that the materiale out
of which they are formed lie scattered throughout the numerous
record offices of the kingdom, frequently unarranged, and often
without indices The consequence is, they are necessarily incom-
plete‚ require more than the labour of alifetime to perfect, and
exoeed the capabilities of any individual effort to accomplish‚
however well directed. Recently steps have been taken by the
British Government to remcdy the evils arising out of the exis-
tence of so many disjointed repositories, and by the centralization
of the whole of the archives of the kingdom under one roof, afford

to the publio, areedy means of access to the records of the nation.

The loss sustained by their neglect may be seen in the report
of the Record Commission‚ issued a few years since. Many
valuable documenta were found to have wholly disappearcd‚ others
to be entirely destroyed, and the majority were more or less injured.
The oldest document extant was the Rotulr' Annales or Grcat Pipc
Roll <ff Boo-curte, of the reign of Henry Ι. Of the Arnay reolo os
tle Miror, but one remained, of uncertain date, of the time of
Edward I.

'Phe most ancient Statum Bou was the statute of Gloucester,
passed in the sixth year of the reign of the sume monarch. Of
