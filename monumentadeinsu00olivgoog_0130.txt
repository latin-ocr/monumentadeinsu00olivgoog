SELDEN'S Turnus OF Horrore-unna. III.

An, 1650.

PEAKING ol lhe kings of the Saron Hephurchy he says:-
'l'he like were those Kings of the Isle of Mon, who were
subject first to the Kinge of Norwey, then to the Orown of
Englend (under King John and Heury ‘nhc third) an'd aflerwnrds
to the Kings of scotland, and since again to the Crown of
England. They both stiled themselves Kings in hhcir Seals
inscribed with Rex Manniae el insularum , und were so titled by

hheir Superiour Lords, ae we see in that of our Henry the third’s
testifying, that he had received the homage of King Reinold.
Sciatis (saith he) quod dilectus et fidelis noster Reginaldus Rex
de Man venit ad fidem eh servitium nostrum eh nobie homagium
feciffl* But they were also in later times, hilled the Lorde of Mon
or Domini Menniae, by which Tillo the Dignity wue not so
restrained that therefore the name of King was taken from them.
For our chorios tell ue expressly‚ that the Lorde of Man hed
withal the name of King and might uec aleo u Crown of Gold: Ι
eo says Thomas of Wulsinghom, where he relules thar Willium
Monlague Earl of Salinhnry, under Richard II. sold the Iele ho
Sir Williem Scrop. Willielmus Scrop (so are hir words) emit
de Domino Willielmo de Monte-acuto Comihe de Sarum, Insulam
Euboniae (which is the old neme ol the Ielc) cum Corone.
Nempe Dominus hujus Insulae Rex vocetur, cui etiam las est,

¹ Know thar our bclored und faithful Regincld, King ol Men, cume to do uc leelly and
senice and mede homage to us.
